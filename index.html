    <h2>History of Paper Drums</h2>
    <p>The evolution of paper drums started as a simple experiment in material science. Over the last two decades, as the world sought more sustainable alternatives, our founders explored using layered compressed paper and resin to create drum shells. The early models were rough, but today’s drums rival traditional wood and plastic shells in durability and sound quality.</p>

    <h2>Tonal Comparison</h2>
    <p>Traditional wooden drums have long been favored for their deep, warm tones. Essay Drums’ paper-bodied drums produce a surprisingly similar timbre with enhanced mid-range resonance. While wooden drums tend to carry lower frequencies, paper drums emphasize clarity and projection, making them perfect for live acoustic settings. Plus, they're significantly lighter to carry!</p>
